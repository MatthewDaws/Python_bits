Python Bits
===========

Various little bits of Python code.

   - `election2017` : Some data messing around the 2017 general election (starting with some data shared with [Leeds Geography MASS group](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/groups/mass/)).  Use of `pandas` and `requests`, which is sort of fun.
   - `m3u_playlists` : Simple script to produce a set of `.m3u` files from directories of ogg files.
